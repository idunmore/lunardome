** Intro **

You are the overseer of an new colony living in an experimental "Lunar Dome".

You must keep the colony functional for as long as possible.

Colonists consume a certain number of units Oxygen (to breathe) and Soup (for
food/water) each year.  You must buy an appropriate amount of Oxygen and Soup
to keep all colonists alive.  Beyond your initial budget, additional funds can
be gained by using excess Oxygen to build, and sell, Lunar Sculptures.

If you run out of Oxygen, Soup then the dome experiment comes to an end, all
colonists return to Earth, and the game ends.

Wear and tear, as well as random calamities (e.g. a meteor strike), reduce the
Integrity of the dome; this results in an annual maintenance charge to restore
Integrity to 100%.

The goal is to keep the Lunar Dome, and hence the Colony, viable for as long
as possible.
