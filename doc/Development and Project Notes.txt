* Intro & Game Description *

 Lunar Dome - Instructions:

 You are the overseer of an new colony living in an experimental "Lunar Dome".
 Your job is to keep the colony functioning for as long as possible.

 Colonists consume a certain number of units of Oxygen (to breathe) and Soup
 (for water/food) each year. On each turn, you must buy enough Oxygen and Soup
 to keep all colonists alive.

 The Integrity of the dome is reduced due to wear-and-tear proportional to the
 number of colonists living in it. An annual maintenance charge is assessed to
 return the dome to 100% integrity. If you have insufficient credits to cover
 this charge, the integrity of the dome will continue to decline.

 Beyond your initial budget, additional funds can be earned by using excess
 Oxygen to build, and sell, "Lunar Sculptures". Be careful not to use up more
 Oxygen than your colonists require when doing so!

 Random events can result in you unexpectedly gaining, or losing, Oxygen or
 Soup, or result in damage (or repairs) to the Integrity of the dome!

 If you run out of Oxygen or Soup, or the Integrity of the dome reaches then the
 colony is no longer viable, the dome experiment comes to an end, all colonists
 return to Earth, and the GAME IS OVER!
